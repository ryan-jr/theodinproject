### Tic Tac Toe

* For implemented and planned features see the planning doc (PlanningDoc.md).  You can also check the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/geH48Ga8/the-odin-project-tic-tac-toe)

* For documentation, there are comments in the code, but feel free to read through the doc folder/index.html which has procedurally generated documentation for all functions/methods via rdoc 

* To use this version of Tic Tac Toe on your local machine clone/download the code base via the 'clone/download' button in the upper right hand corner of Github.  If you chose to download it as a ZIP archive be sure to unzip the code to the directory you want.  The game was implemented in Ruby 2.3.0, make sure you have the correct version by checking ruby -v in your command line.  If you don't have Ruby you can get it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).  Once you have Ruby updated/downloaded open up your Powershell/Bash Command Line Interface and navigate to the directory where Tic Tac Toe is at.  When you are in the directory enter: 

> ruby tic_tac_toe.rb 

in order to play the game.  

* Have fun!
