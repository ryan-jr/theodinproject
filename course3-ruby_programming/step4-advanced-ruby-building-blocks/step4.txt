-the unless command is the oppositie of true and checks to see if something is false rather than if something is true 

### EXAMPLE CODE 
hungry = false

unless hungry
  puts "I'm writing Ruby programs!"
else
  puts "Time to eat!"
end

-because unless is the opposite keyword of end, just like if it requires an end  to close the statement.  

-the primary booleans in ruby are && (true && false) == false, || (true || false) == true, and ! ( 1 != 2) == true.  


-until is a compliment of the while loop and looks like: 

The complement to the while loop is the until loop. It's sort of like a backwards while:

In the example below, we first create a variable i and set it to zero.
Then we execute a block of code until i is equal to 11. That block of code increments i.
When i is equal to 11, the block ends.
Finally, we print i, the value of i, to the console.
counter = 1
until counter == 11
  puts counter
  counter += 1
  
end


-the following for loop is EXCLUSIVE of the last number:
-for loops are used if we know how much we're going to be looping through/iterating through something 


for num in 1...10
  puts num
end

-in ruby {} for an iterator block are interchangable with do and end keywords 

-the next keyword is used to skip code blocks and skip back to the top of the loop, and can be used either before an if block or within it like so:

i = 20
loop do
  i -= 1
  next if i % 2 != 0
  print "#{i}"
  break if i <= 0
end


OR (note however, that the following requires an end to close the statement)

i = 20
loop do
  i -= 1
  if i % 2 != 0
      next 
  end
  print "#{i}"
  break if i <= 0
end


### CODEACADEMY ###
The loop iterator is the simplest, but also one of the least powerful. A more useful iterator is the .each method, which can apply an expression to each element of an object, one at a time. The syntax looks like this:

object.each { |item| # Do something }
You can also use the do keyword instead of {}:

object.each do |item| # Do something end
The variable name between | | can be anything you like: it's just a placeholder for each element of the object you're using .each on.

### END ### 


-the .times method is also valid, for .times you have to put a number in numeral format in front of .times 

10.times do
    print "hello"
end


Another until example:
ctr = 0

until ctr == 50
    ctr += 1
    print ctr


end

Rewritten as:
ctr = 51

until ctr == 0
    ctr -= 1
    print ctr


end

### another for loop example 

for num in 1..50 
	puts num 
end 


### another loop example 

ctr = 0

loop do
    ctr += 1
    print "Ruby!"
    break if ctr == 30
end 

### CODEACADEMY REDACTED PROJECT ### 

puts "Words to search through"
text = gets.chomp

puts "Words to redact"
redact = gets.chomp

words = text.split(" ")

words.each do |word|
if word == redact
    print "REDACTED "
else
    print text + " "
end
end


-a 2 dimensional array, is simply an array within an array like so:
my_2d_array = [["a","b","c"]]


-Ruby hashes/dictionaries look like so:

hash = {
  key1 => value1,
  key2 => value2,
  key3 => value3
}


We can add to a hash two ways: if we created it using literal notation, we can simply add a new key-value pair directly between the curly braces. If we used Hash.new, we can add to the hash using bracket notation:

pets = Hash.new
pets["Stevie"] = "cat"
# Adds the key "Stevie" with the
# value "cat" to the hash

You can access values in a hash just like an array.

pets = {
  "Stevie" => "cat",
  "Bowser" => "hamster",
  "Kevin Sorbo" => "fish"
}

puts pets["Stevie"]
# will print "cat"
In the example above, we create a hash called pets.
Then we print cat by accessing the key "Stevie" in the `pets hash.

### Multidimensional arrays

Iterating Over Multidimensional Arrays
Now let's see how to iterate over a multidimensional array.

We've created a 2-D array, s (for "sandwiches"). We want to iterate over s in such a way that we don't print out each element, like ["ham", "swiss"], but each element within each element, so we get a list of all the meats and cheeses within s.

If we just wanted to access "swiss", we could type

s[0][1]
Meaning, "bring me the second element of the first element," which is "swiss." If we iterate over a regular array using

array.each { |element| action }
then how might we iterate over an array of arrays?




Instructions
Puts out every element inside the sub-arrays inside s.

Iterate through .each element in the s array. Call the elements sub_array.
Then iterate through .each sub_array and puts out their items.


### CODE: 
s = [["ham", "swiss"], ["turkey", "cheddar"], ["roast beef", "gruyere"]]



s.each do |sub_array|
    sub_array.each do |element|
        puts element
end
    
end


### Iterating over hashes 

When iterating over hashes, we need two placeholder variables to represent each key/value pair.

restaurant_menu = {
  "noodles" => 4,
  "soup" => 3,
  "salad" => 2
}

restaurant_menu.each do |item, price|
  puts "#{item}: #{price}"
end
In the example above, we create a new hash called restaurant_menu.
Then, we loop through the restaurant_menu hash and assign the key to item and the value to price for each iteration.
Finally, we puts out:
noodles: 4
soup: 3
salad: 2
Instructions
Use .each to iterate over the secret_identities hash.
Use puts to print each key-value pair, separated by a colon and a space (:), to the console, just like the example above.


### CODE: 
secret_identities = {
  "The Batman" => "Bruce Wayne",
  "Superman" => "Clark Kent",
  "Wonder Woman" => "Diana Prince",
  "Freakazoid" => "Dexter Douglas"
}
  

secret_identities.each do |id, name|
    puts "#{id}: #{name}"
end

We've done a fair amount of iteration over arrays, so to finish up, let's review how to iterate over a hash.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.each { |element| puts element }
Instructions
Iterate through .each key/value pair in lunch_order.
Please puts out the value of each pair (just the value, not the key).


### CODE:
lunch_order = {
  "Ryan" => "wonton soup",
  "Eric" => "hamburger",
  "Jimmy" => "sandwich",
  "Sasha" => "salad",
  "Cole" => "taco"
}



lunch_order.each do |key, value|
   puts value 
end


### This is what i need for project 3 
puts "Enter some text"
text = gets.chomp

words = text.split

frequencies = Hash.new(0)

words.each do |word|
    frequencies[word] += 1
end

frequencies = frequencies.sort_by { |k, v| v }
frequencies.reverse!

frequencies.each do |key, value|
    puts "#{key} #{value}"
end


-for methods/functions you can use the *(splat) indicator before an argument to denote that there will be multiple arguments being associated with that variable

# EXAMPLE:
def what_up(greeting, *bros)
  bros.each { |bro| puts "#{greeting}, #{bro}!" }
end
 
what_up("What up", "Justin", "Ben", "Kevin Sorbo")


-abstracting is a means of making things simpler:
	-you could say "let's look at this lovely combo of windows, paint, doors, and a roof", or just abstract it and say "let's look at this lovely house"
	
-.stort! works on letters as well as numbers

-<=> is a comparison sort operator, it compares two objects and returns 0 if the first item being compared is equal to the second, 1 if the first operand is greater than and -1 if the first operand is less than the second.  



What if we wanted to sort the books by title, but from Z – A, or descending order? It appears that Ruby's sort method only works for A – Z, or ascending order.

The sort method assumes by default that you want to sort in ascending order, but it accepts a block as an optional argument that allows you, the programmer, to specify how two items should be compared.

Instructions
Sort your books in descending order on line 8. Use the example of sorting in ascending order on line 4 as a guide.

# CODE:

books = ["Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "War and Peace", "Utopia", "A Brief History of Time", "A Wrinkle in Time"]

# To sort our books in ascending order, in-place
books.sort! { |firstBook, secondBook| firstBook <=> secondBook }

# Sort your books in descending order, in-place below
books.sort! { |secondBook, firstBook| secondBook <=> firstBook }



-default paramaters in ruby are passed like a variable assignment 

-in Ruby only nil and false are regarded as non-true, everything else is 'truthy'

-if you try to access a key in a hash/dictionary that is not there, it will evaluate to/return nil 
-in Ruby you can create default values to be in a hash so that it does not return nil with:

no_nil_hash = Hash.new("hello")


-symbols are denoted with :this, symbols are not strings and there can only be one copy of any particular symbol at a given time.

#Code EXAMPLE:
my_first_symbol = :symbol

#CODE EXAMPLE
#Pushing text strings from an array onto a new array as symbols 

strings = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]

# Add your code below!

symbols = []

strings.each do |s|
    symbols.push(s.to_sym)
end 

- .intern does pretty much the same thing as .to_sym 

-just like in arrays you have to put , between things in a elements/items in a hash/dictionary 


- newer syntax for hashes: 
movies = {
    hello: "world",
    new:   "movie"
    
      }

#hello, and new are still symbols.  


#### Using select to find specific values given a set of constraints 

movie_ratings = {
  memento: 3,
  primer: 3.5,
  the_matrix: 5,
  truman_show: 4,
  red_dawn: 1.5,
  skyfall: 4,
  alex_cross: 2,
  uhf: 1,
  lion_king: 3.5
}



good_movies = movie_ratings.select { |name, rating| rating > 3 }



We know how to grab a specific value from a hash by specifying the associated key, but what if we want to filter a hash for values that meet certain criteria? For that, we can use .select.

grades = { alice: 100,
  bob: 92,
  chris: 95,
  dave: 97
}

grades.select {|name, grade| grade < 97}
# ==> {:bob=>92, :chris=>95}

grades.select { |k, v| k == :alice }
# ==> {:alice=>100}



In the example above, we first create a grades hash that maps symbols to integers.
Then we call the .select method and pass in a block of code. The block contains an expression for selecting matching key/value pairs. It returns a hash containing :bob and :chris.
Finally, we call the .select method again. Our block looks only for the key :alice. This is an inefficient method of getting a key/value pair, but it shows that .select does not modify the hash.
(Here we're using "name" or "k" to stand for the key and "grade" or "v" to stand for the value, but as usual with blocks, you can call your variables whatever you like.)

### CODE EXAMPLE
#In ruby you can either print just the key or just the value 


Great work!

We've often found we only want the key or value associated with a key/value pair, and it's kind of a pain to put both into our block and only work with one. Can we iterate over just keys or just values?

This is Ruby. Of course we can.

Ruby includes two hash methods, .each_key and .each_value, that do exactly what you'd expect:

my_hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }

my_hash.each_key { |k| print k, " " }
# ==> one two three

my_hash.each_value { |v| print v, " " }
# ==> 1 2 3
Let's wrap up our study of Ruby hashes and symbols by testing these methods out.


movie_ratings = {
  memento: 3,
  primer: 3.5,
  the_matrix: 3,
  truman_show: 4,
  red_dawn: 1.5,
  skyfall: 4,
  alex_cross: 2,
  uhf: 1,
  lion_king: 3.5
}
# Add your code below!

movie_ratings.each_key do |key|
    puts key
end


-the case statment is associated with a variable and the conditionals are noted with when and a specific operation/input:

choice = gets.chomp

case choice
when "add"
    puts "Added!"
when "update"
    puts "Updated!"
when "display"
    puts "Movies!"
when "delete"
    puts "Deleted!"
else
end

-Apparently you add to hashes in a SUPER weird way when you have variables 
# the hash variable name is movies along with the title and rating variables 

moves[title] = rating

To make the above accurate we need to use .to_sym and .to_i on the title and rating respectively

movies[title.to_sym] = rating.to_i

-to remove things from a hash we just need to call the .delete method on the hash and the key of what it is we want to delete, which will remove the key and the value.  

movies.delete(hello)




### ADD, UPDATE, READ, DELETE with a Ruby Hash 

movies = {
    Wrinkle_in_time: 1
    
    
    
}

puts "What would you like to do?"
puts "Type 'add', to add a movie"
puts "Type 'update', to update a rating"
puts "Type 'display', to display the movies/ratings"
puts "Type 'delete', to remove a movie/rating"

choice = gets.chomp

case choice
when "add"
    puts "input a movie title!"
    title = gets.chomp
    puts "input a rating 1 to 5, 1 being the best"
    rating = gets.chomp
    title = title
    rating = rating
    if movies[title.to_sym] = nil
        movies[title.to_sym] = rating.to_i
    else
        puts "This movie is already in the system!"
    end
when "update"
    puts "Type the movie title you want to update!"
    title = gets.chomp
    if movies[title.to_sym] = nil
        puts "This movie is not in the system!"
    else
        puts "What is new rating?"
        rating = gets.chomp
        movies[title.to_sym] = rating.to_i
end
when "display"
    movies.each do |movie, rating|
        puts "#{movie}: #{rating}"
    end
when "delete"
    puts "What is the title you want to remove?"
    title = gets.chomp
    if movies[title.to_sym] = nil
        puts "Error! The movie is not in the system!"
    else
        movies.delete(title)
    end
else
end
    puts "Error!"
	

### Blocks, Procs, and Lambadas

-if we want to perform operations on an array BUT NOT mutate/change the original array, we can use the .collect method like so 

fibs = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

# Add your code below!
doubled_fibs = []


fibs.collect do |dubs|
    dub = dubs * 2
    doubled_fibs << dub
end

doubled_fibs


### YIELD 
-OK yield is a bit strange to try and wrap your head around, but basically yield pauses the code that is being executed in the method, and instead runs the code that was in the block that called it, and then runs the rest of the code in the method.  


https://learn.co/lessons/yield-and-blocks


Think of the yield keyword as saying "stop executing the code in this method and instead execute the code in the block. Then, return to the code in the method."

Here's an example:
def hello
	puts "hello"
	yield 
	puts "world"
end

hello do
	puts "there"
end 

#OUTPUT OF ABOVE CODE 
# hello 
# there 
# world 

ALSO:

def yield_name(name)
  puts "In the method! Let's yield."
  yield("Kim")
  puts "In between the yields!"
  yield(name)
  puts "Block complete! Back in the method."
end

yield_name("Eric") { |n| puts "My name is #{n}." }

# Now call the method with your name!

yield_name("RJR") do |name|
    puts "#{name}"
    
end

### ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF YIELD 

def double(num)
    
    yield(num)


end


double(2) do |num|
    num * 2
end


# PROCs 
-so Procs are simply PROCcesses that can be assigned to a variable 

you can write a proc a couple of ways for example 

=begin 

The .floor method rounds a float (a number with a decimal) down to the nearest integer. Write a proc called round_down that will do this rounding (we've added the code to pass it to floats.collect).

=end 

floats = [1.2, 3.45, 0.91, 7.727, 11.42, 482.911]
# Write your code below this line!


round_down = Proc.new do |x|
    x.floor 
    end

#The above also works as:
# round_down = Proc.new { |x| x.floor }
# remeber that anything between the pipes is a placeholder, and 
# { } simply stands in for DO and END 


# Write your code above this line!
ints = floats.collect(&round_down)

-when you're calling a method and passing it to a proc, you have to include the ampersadn before the proc you call in parens


### Codeacademy STUFFS 
Instructions
Create a method, greeter, that takes no arguments and yields to a block.
Create a Proc, phrase, that puts "Hello there!". Pass this to greeter instead of a block. (Don't forget to pass &phrase instead of just phrase!) 

***CODE: 
def greeter
    
    yield

end


phrase = Proc.new do 
    
    puts "Hello there!"
    
    end
    
greeter(&phrase)

### 

Calling a proc with a method isn't too tricky. However, there's an even easier way.

Unlike blocks, we can call procs directly by using Ruby's .call method.

Remember: there's always more than one way to do something in Ruby.

hi = Proc.new do 
    
    puts "Hello!"

    end
    
hi.call

#LAMBADAS 
Lambda Syntax
Lambdas are defined using the following syntax:

lambda { |param| block }
Lambdas are useful in the same situations in which you'd use a proc. 

#EXAMPLE CODE 

strings = ["leonardo", "donatello", "raphael", "michaelangelo"]
# Write your code below this line!


symbolize =  lambda { |param| param.to_sym } 


# Write your code above this line!
symbols = strings.collect(&symbolize)

If you're thinking that procs and lambdas look super similar, that's because they are! There are only two main differences.

First, a lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, while a proc does not. This means that a lambda will throw an error if you pass it the wrong number of arguments, whereas a proc will ignore unexpected arguments and assign nil to any that are missing.

Second, when a lambda returns, it passes control back to the calling method; when a proc returns, it does so immediately, without going back to the calling method.


Create a lambda, symbol_filter, that takes one parameter and checks to see if that parameter .is_a? Symbol.
Create a new variable called symbols, and store the result of calling my_array.select and passing it your lambda.


my_array = ["raindrops", :kettles, "whiskers", :mittens, :packages]

# Add your code below!

symbol_filter = lambda { |param| param.is_a?Symbol }

symbols = my_array.select(&symbol_filter)


Quick Review
All this talk of blocks, procs, and lambdas might have your head spinning. Let's take a minute to clarify exactly what each one is:

A block is just a bit of code between do..end or {}. It's not an object on its own, but it can be passed to methods like .each or .select.
A proc is a saved block we can use over and over.
A lambda is just like a proc, only it cares about the number of arguments it gets and it returns to its calling method rather than returning immediately.
Yeild is a command that will temporary pause the code being run in the metho and pass the information back to the block that called it.  


The odds_n_ends array is full of all sorts of objects, but we only want the integers (numbers without decimal bits).

Create a new variable, ints, and store the result of calling odds_n_ends.select method with a block that checks if the element .is_a? Integer.

odds_n_ends = [:weezard, 42, "Trady Blix", 3, true, 19, 12.345]

check = lambda { |int| int.is_a?Integer }

ints = odds_n_ends.select(&check)


Now we'll be using the ages array. Create a variable called youngsters and set it equal to calling .select on ages, and pass in your under_100 proc to filter for the ages that are less than one hundred. Remember to pass &under_100 to convert your proc to a block!


ages = [23, 101, 7, 104, 11, 94, 100, 121, 101, 70, 44]

under_100 = Proc.new do |num|
   
   num < 100
    
end

youngsters = ages.select(&under_100)

To finish up, let's go ahead and create a variable called a_to_m and set it equal to calling .select on crew, and pass in your first_half lambda to filter for the names that are before "M" in the alphabet. Remember to pass &first_half to convert your lambda to a block!

crew = {
  captain: "Picard",
  first_officer: "Riker",
  lt_cdr: "Data",
  lt: "Worf",
  ensign: "Ro",
  counselor: "Troi",
  chief_engineer: "LaForge",
  doctor: "Crusher"
}
# Add your code below!


first_half = lambda { | key, value | value < "M" }

a_to_m = crew.select(&first_half)



### Ruby Explained 
# http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-conditionals-and-flow-control 


-Truthiness and Falsiness are ways of asking what evaluates to true.  For ruby everything that is not nil or false evaluates to truthy
 
-unless is the opposite of an if statement, basically with unless, if something is false it will execute that code.  

-the spaceship operator compares two objects and gives different outputs based upon wether the thing on the left side is greater than, less than, or equal to the right side.  

-the logical operators are &&, ||, and !.  with && both sides of the equation must be true, with || either side of the equation must be true, with ! it will flip the value.  

-logical operations follow the order of operations from left to right unless parens are involved, which are evaluated first.  


Ruby is Lazy which means two things here:

It will only evaluate far enough to determine that the expression is definitively true or false.
It will return whatever is returned by the last part of the expression to get evaluated (instead of just a simple true or false it relies on that returned thing being truthy or falsey).

 For another example, 7 || nil returns 7 (which behaves truthy) instead of true and 7 && nil returns nil (which behaves falsey) instead of false If this seems a bit much to swallow right off the bat, keep it in the back of your mind until you first see it in action then it will click.

 
 ||= is a sneaky expression that takes advantage of Ruby's natural laziness -- it basically expands to thing_a || thing_a = thing_b. So if thing_a hasn't been set to anything, it becomes thing_b, otherwise it keeps its original value. It's a bit complex and you don't need to know exactly why it works, but we'll go over it for completeness:

If thing_a hasn't yet been assigned to anything, it is nil and Ruby then checks the right side of the || to see if that might be true, which involves running the expression to set thing_a = thing_b. If it has already been assigned a value, it just keeps that value like normal. This is another sneaky trick used by programmers in situations like when you don't want to override whatever's already been set, but you want something to be there (like which url originally referred the user to your site)

You may have seen some oddly compact and strange looking statements that appeared to be if statements under the hood. That's probably because they use the Ternary Operator, which is a shorthand notation for a simple if that separates the different parts using the ? and : like:

condition ? do_this_if_true : do_this_if_false

So:

> true ? puts "I like truth" : puts "not gonna happen"
"I like truth"
=> nil
You can also nest if statements inside one another. Sometimes it gets a little crazy and you find yourself 6 levels deep (and probably needing to rethink your strategy). For those situations where you're really just checking to see if something equals any one of a number of clear but different options, a case statement can be a good substitute. It basically lets you construct a chain of logic that says "if x equals option_a, do this, if it equals option_b, do this, if it equals option_c, do this... and otherwise do this."

case current_user.energy   # Assume it's an value 1-3
when 3
    puts "Go run a marathon!"
when 2
    puts "Go for a walk."
when 1
    puts "Go take a nap"
else
    puts "You're only supposed to have energy of 1,2 or 3..."

	
	
-ternary operators simply use ? and : in place of if/else statements and are more compact.  

-case statements are more succinct because they allow you to not go 6 levels deep with if/else statements.


# Ruby Explained: Iteration 

-the index variable keeps track of which iteration you are on in a loop and is usually found inbetween | | 

- the .loop is the most basic way to loop in ruby, and is not oft seen because other methods have more flexibility, because the .loop command is stopped with a break command.  


-since most things involve iterating over a hash or an array in ruby we usually use the .each method.  Where most other methods just do something a certain number of times, the .each method will pass whater item it is currently on in the array/hash into the code block.  


-while is another way to do it as is until, but the until command runs as long as the condition is/evalutates to FALSE

# Example of while and until loops 

i = 0 
while i < 5 
	puts "#{i}"
	i += 1 
end 

i = 0 
until i >= 5 
	puts "#{i}"
	i += 1 
end 

- for is used in a number of languages, but gets less love in ruby but you can still use it like so:

for x in (1..3) 	#1 up to and INCLUDING 3 
	puts "#{x}"
end 

-the times method is an incredibly simple method that take the value of the current iteration an pass it to the block if you have an index variable.

# w/ pipe variable:
5.times do |num| 

	puts "hello "
end 

# w/o pipe variable: 
5.times { puts "hello" } 

-other methods include the .upto method which looks like:
1.upto(4) { | current_num | ...code... }, this is basically like the .times method but you choose the starting and ending points.  The inverse of this is the .downto method.  


Your best friends early on will be while for anything that needs to run until a certain condition is reached (like winning the game), #each for any time you want to do stuff with every item in an array or hash, and #times for the simple cases when you just want to do something a fixed number of times.

-to have more control over loops you can use the break statement to stop loops, and is usually seen with an if statment.  

-you can also use next, which will jump to the next iteraton of the loop.  

-don't use return to exit a loop, since it will exit an entire method as well.  


-Nesting loops are when one loop occurs inside of another, so that you you execute the inner loop each time you go through the outer loop.  This happens with '2d problesm' like searching arrays w/in arrays.  
  

  
# Ruby Explained: Blocks, Procs, and Lambadas 

-blocks are just that blocks of code (usually seen in loops), and are usually enclosed/declared with { } OR can be enclosed with do...end

-blocks should be used with the implicit return and not the explict return.  

-blocks are used as arguments to other methods (.each anyone?), and the .each method is built to accept a block as an argument, because blocks are used as arguments to other methods, so blocks are not THAT special, they just usually take up multiple lines.  

-the yield statement is pretty important at this point because it allows you to pass back/push back/call back to the block of code that called a particular method etc... 
EXAMPLE:

def hello
    puts "hello"
    yield 
    puts "world"
end

hello do
    puts "there"
end 

>hello 
>there
>world 

So one reason blocks are great is because you can write a sort of generic method like #each which wraps your block in code that says what to do with it. Another use case is when creating methods where you want to optionally be able to override how they "work" internally by supplying your own block

Here's a theoretical example more like what you might see when you've got your own website built using Rails, where we may want to send only an array filled with our users' emails out to the webpage:

u = User.all
@user_emails = u.map { |user| user.email }

You can also use these methods on hashes as well, just remember that now you have two inputs to work with for your block:

> my_hash = {"Joe" => "male", "Jim" => "male", "Patty" => "female"}
> my_hash.select{|name, gender| gender == "male" }
=> {"Joe" => "male", "Jim" => "male"}

-a proc is short for procedure, and is just a block that you save to a variable like so:

my_proc = Proc.new { |arg1| print "#{arg1}! " } 
>[1,2,3].each(&my_proc)
>1, 2, 3

-NOTE that when you call the proc in the () you have to use the &.  


-Blocks and Procs are both a type of "closure". A closure is basically a formal, computer-science-y way of saying "a chunk of code that you can pass around but which hangs onto the variables that you gave it when you first called it"





-Lambdas are closer to methods because you can use explict returns and return multiple values at once, and lambdas are also very strict about you having to pass the correct number of arguments to it.  

# EXAMPLE 

lambda do |word| 
>   puts word
>   return word            # you can do this in lambdas not Procs
> end.call("howdy ")
howdy => "howdy "        # not nil because we gave it a return

Blocks are unnamed little code chunks you can drop into other methods. Used all the time.

Procs are identical to blocks but you can store them in variables, which lets you pass them into functions as explicit arguments and save them for later. Used explicitly sometimes.

Lambdas are really full methods that just haven't been named. Used rarely.
Methods are a way of taking actual named methods and passing them around as arguments to or returns from other methods in your code. Used rarely.

Closure is just the umbrella term for all four of those things, which all somehow involve passing around chunks of code.

# Ruby Explained: Map, Select, and Other Enumerable Methods
# http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-map-select-and-other-enumerable-methods

-the .select method takes or SELECTS item based upon certain criteria that you feed it and will run the block on every item of the object you pass it, and return a new object that contains only the items for which the block returned true:
  
my_array.select{|item| item%2==0 }
=> [2,4,6,8,100]      # wow, that was easy.



.map and .collect DO THE SAME THING:

What if instead of selecting only a few items we want to keep all items but modify them somehow? That sounds a lot like we're doing something and collecting the results, doesn't it?  #collect will run your block and give you an object filled with whatever your block returned each time. Ruby says:

> my_array.collect{|num| num**2 }
=> [4,16,36,64,10000]

You've heard of #map? It's the EXACT same method as collect, just called something different. Some people visualize it in their heads as doing something and collecting the results, other people see it as re-mapping your original object through some sort of transformation. It's more conventional to use #map but both work the same way.
-NOTE THAT MAP AND COLLECT RETURN A NEW ARRAY 

-we can use the .inject method to keep a running total of integers/floats in an array.  The .inject method will default to the 0th item in the array, but you can specify the starting point with .inject(3) for example.  INJECT WILL SUM TO THE RESULT OF THE LAST ITERATION IS, SO WE HAVE TO KEEP A RUNNING TOTAL OF THINGS.  


[1, 2, 3, 4].inject(0) { |result, element| result + element } # => 10


-This offers a REALLY good explanation of things:

OTHER HANDY METHODS:

Enumerable is a large bunch of methods and you'll only use a half-dozen of them regularly but there are some others that you should be familiar with as well. The full list is available in the docs here.

#any? returns true/false (see the question mark?) and answers the question, "do ANY of the elements in this object pass the test in my block?". If your block returns true on any time it runs, any? will return true.
#all? returns true/false and answers the question, "do ALL the elements of this object pass the test in my block?". Every time the block runs it must return true for this method to return true.
#none? returns true only if NONE of the elements in the object return true when the block is run.
#find returns the first item in your object for which the block returns true.
Awesome but less common methods

#group_by will run your block and return a hash that groups all the different types of returns from that block. For example:

> names = ["James", "Bob", "Joe", "Mark", "Jim"]
> names.group_by{|name| name.length}
=> {5=>["James"], 3=>["Bob", "Joe", "Jim"], 4=>["Mark"]} 
#grep returns an array with those items that actualy match the specified criteria (RegEx) (using a === match)

> names.grep(/J/)
=> ["James", "Joe", "Jim"]
Some of the methods you've already seen and use are part of Enumerable too -- #include?, #sort, #count etc.

When you use the Enumerable methods, you'll sometimes see what's called an enumerator object pop up, usually if you forget to give them a parameter that they want like a block. What the heck is that?

Consider it an implementation detail of Enumerator. As we said before, the methods that are part of Enumerable rely on the underlying collections' #each method to work.  enumerable is basically a go-between for the original collection and Enumerator. It's not really something you'll be using right off the bat but it's useful for gaining a better understanding of Enumerable.


# Ruby Explained: Methods 
# http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-writing-and-running-methods

-each method should do one thing
-the should do this in order to keep things organized and clear 

-Methods should be SHORT! If they're >10 lines, you're probably doing too much. When you look at the open-source projects on Github, their methods are often incredibly short. Good code doesn't look long, it looks brief but descriptive.


-When naming methods the goal is to be descriptive but short. Name based on what it will return or what the major intended side effect will be. You shouldn't be missing any parts from the name because the method should only do one thing anyway. I
