Intro to Algorithims

Algorithim: A set of steps to acomplish a task
Examples:
-compression algortihims (used in google vidoe)
-Maps use route finding algorithims
-Nasa uses Optimization algorithims
-minimax algorithims make chess AIs that never lose
-new algorithims are constantly being created for weather, astronomy, biology, data analysis, etc...


What makes a good algorithim?
1.  Is correct
2.  Is efficent

-in some cases, nearly good is good enough, such as in the case of a path finding algorithim
-we measure efficency in Asymptotic Analysis which evalutes algorithims absent hardware, language, etc...



Algorithims
-iterating through each number in a guessing game to get the number is a linear search, but bisecting each set of numbers is a binary search, which is able to significantly reduce the number of guesses.  
-path finding algorithims require bounds on what is/is not valid for movement
