Things I've learned along the way
1.  Break up a problem into smaller problems if you can
2.  Understand the boundries/bounds/range/scope of the problem, this can help you understand edge cases
3.  Chances are you will not entirely understand the problem the first time, keep pressing on.  
4.  This line is pretty handy in ruby:   array.inject(0, :+)
5.  So is this: it numbers.reduce(:*)
6.  Full Stack means: everything from the web page to the database/back end
7.  The .join method is pretty awesome
8.  A problem might take hours, but it feels great onece you've solved it.  
9.  You will get stuck...and feel stupid
10.  It's OK to skip around.
