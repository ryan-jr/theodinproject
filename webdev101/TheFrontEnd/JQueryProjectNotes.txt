THE STRUGGLE THROUGH JQUERY

-the '$' in Jquery simply stands in for writing out jQuery/calling jQuery on everything we want to run.  

Basic Syntax:

Basic syntax is: $(selector).action()

A dollar sign to define jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)


Why we put $ in front of some variables/things:


No there is no real difference.

It's just a convention that helps you remember that a isn't the DOM element but it's a jQuery object.

var a = document.getElementById('a');
a.innerHTML  //fine

var $a = $('#a');
$a.html()   // fine
Ohhh, and by the way, neither a or $a are good variable names ... you should use meaningful variable names not abc characters.

Read the jQuery info tag on this very same site:

Variable Naming Conventions

jQuery wrapped variables are usually named starting with '$' to distinguish them from standard JavaScript objects.

var $this = $(this);

EXPLAINING THIS CODE:
var $row = $("<div />", {
    class: 'row'
});

the var $row defines this as a jquery element, and the ("<div />", { creates the self closing div tag
the { opens up the handler of jquery to let you tell it what you want it to do, and from there you assign it to the class
 of 'row' and then close out the jquery call.
