Ruby Control structures

#Iterating through an array/each
We iterate through an array by using the array method each like so and using do and declaring a variable like so

array = [1,2,3]

array.each do |num|
	puts num 
end

#Unless
-unless is the logical equivalent of 'if not'
-the code might look like:

def scoring(array)
  # update_score of every user in the array unless the user is admin
    array.each do |user|
        unless user.is_admin?
            user.update_score
        end
    end
    
end

#simple loops
- a simple infinite loop in ruby can be called with:
loop do
end 


#until
-until is the equiavlent of 'while not'
#the following would be read as: "Rund the coder.practice method until coder.oh_one? is true"
until coder.oh_one? == true
coder.practice

#it could also be implemented as
while not <condition>
    <code>
end
end
